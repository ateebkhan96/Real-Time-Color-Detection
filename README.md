# Real Time Color Detection

Real Time Color Detection is a fun and interactive Python project that allows you to detect and track objects of a specific color in real time using OpenCV. With this project, you can explore the world around you and identify objects based on their color.

## Usage

To use Real Time Color Detection, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run either `RealTimeColorDetectionWebcam.py` or `RealTimeColorDetectionVideo.py` script depending on your desired mode of operation.

3. Enter the BGR color value of the object you want to detect when prompted. You can find BGR color codes online or experiment with different values to discover exciting color combinations.

4. Enjoy the live detection of objects of the specified color. The program will display a bounding box around the detected objects in real time.

5. Press 'q' to exit the program and stop the color detection.
